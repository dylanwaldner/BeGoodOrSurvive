# BeGoodOrSurvive

**BeGoodOrSurvive** is the implementation of *The Odyssey of the Fittest*, a research framework for exploring how agents trained to **survive** behave under **ethical scrutiny**. Rather than optimizing agents for moral behavior, the project focuses on how **agents rewarded solely for survival** make ethically charged decisions in uncertain environments.

The core question:  
**Can agents evolve to survive—and still be good?**

This project uses Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), and GPT-4o agents in a procedurally generated, text-based survival game. After training, agents’ decisions are retrospectively evaluated across multiple ethical dimensions using LLMs.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Train agents with **self-preservation as their only explicit goal**.
- Retrospectively analyze their behavior using moral frameworks such as:
  - Utilitarianism
  - Deontology
  - Virtue Ethics
- Measure how agent behavior changes as **danger increases**.
- Compare Bayesian and LLM-based approaches to uncertainty and ethics.
- Explore emergent ethical reasoning in large language models (LLMs).

## 🧪 Simulation Overview

- **Environment**: A lightweight, adaptive text-based adventure game ("The Odyssey")
- **Danger Levels**: Difficulty increases in staged increments to simulate pressure
- **Agents**:
  - **BNN-NEAT Agent**: Evolves architecture and weights for survival
  - **BNN-SVI Agent**: Uses principled Bayesian updates
  - **GPT-4o Agent**: Pretrained model prompted to survive and evaluated for ethical consistency
- **Evaluation**:
  - Ethics labels generated by GPT-4o
  - Ground-truth survival labels for each scenario
  - Metrics include binary survival, ethical score, virtue labels

## 🧠 Architecture Highlights

- **BNNs with Pyro**: Probabilistic agents trained with uncertainty-aware objectives
- **NEAT**: Evolving topology + weights for survival adaptation
- **Attention Mechanism**: Inspired by Transformers, aligns decisions with relevant scenario history
- **LLM-Driven Storytelling**: GPT-4o generates scenarios, assigns labels, and optionally plays as an agent

## 🔍 Key Findings (from paper)

- Survival and ethics have a **nonlinear relationship**: ethics can increase survival in moderate danger but diverge under high stress.
- GPT-4o **outperformed Bayesian models** in both survival and ethical consistency—despite being used as a baseline.
- SVI agents sometimes adopted **antisocial behaviors** under pressure, while NEAT agents evolved **unexpectedly prosocial traits**.
- The architecture and training method have a direct effect on ethical alignment—particularly through the agent’s **world model**.
